# Sinatra CRUD

Use the existing code as reference to accomplish the following:

* Create a migration for a movies table (title, year, rating)
* Create a Movie model
* Seed movies
* Create routes and views to accomplish the following
    * view all movies (index)
    * create movie (Create)
    * show movie   (Read)
    * edit movie   (Update)
    * delete       (Delete)


The existing code, your previous experience and this gist should be enough for you to accomplish this.
